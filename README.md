Name :  Vaibhav Dubey Intern ID :CT04DL1732 DOMAIN: Python Programming DURATION : 4 WEEKS MENTOR: Neela Santosh Kumar Project Title: Predictive Machine Learning Model Using Scikit-learn (Spam Detection Example)

Project Description:

This project demonstrates how to build and evaluate a predictive machine learning model using Scikit-learn in Python. The example use-case is spam email detection, where the model classifies emails as either "spam" or "not spam" based on their content. This type of classification task is common in email filtering, text classification, and customer feedback analysis.

Objective:

The main objective is to showcase the full machine learning workflow—from data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and performance visualization—using a clean and well-documented Jupyter Notebook.

Project Workflow:

Data Loading: Load a labeled dataset (e.g., from CSV or a public source like UCI).

Preprocessing: Clean the text data, tokenize, remove stopwords, and convert text to numerical features using TF-IDF.

Model Training: Use Scikit-learn to train a classifier such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or SVM.

Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

Visualization: Use matplotlib or seaborn to visualize performance metrics and results.

Deliverables:

A Jupyter Notebook with:

Clean, annotated code

Visualizations

Model training and evaluation
